# Competitive Programming Template

My competitive programming template mostly in use on [codeforces.com](https://codeforces.com).

Features:

* `<<` operator defined for `vector`, `map`, `set`, `pair` and `tuple` for quick printing. 
* `DBG()` function for printing of variables including their names, e.g. `int a = 5; int b = 3; DBG(a, b);` prints `a=5, b=3`. It doesn't print anything when submitted to an online judge as it checks if `ONLINE_JUDGE` was defined.
* Standard `ll`, `pll`, `vll`, fast input.
